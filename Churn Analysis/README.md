# 📉 Customer Retention & Churn Analysis (Telecom / SaaS)

## ❓ Business Problem Statement

The company has observed a **consistent increase in customer churn over recent months**, leading to declining recurring revenue and higher customer acquisition costs. While new customers continue to join, a significant portion of existing customers discontinue their service before realizing long-term value.

Currently, stakeholders lack visibility into:
- **Which customers are most likely to churn**
- **What factors drive churn behavior**
- **Whether churn is concentrated within specific customer segments, plans, or usage patterns**

Without actionable insights, retention strategies remain reactive rather than data-driven.
