# 📊 Superstore Sales & Profitability Analysis (Tableau)

## 🧠 About the Project
This project presents an in-depth **Business Intelligence analysis of the Superstore dataset** with the objective of understanding **profitability patterns across states, categories, and sub-categories**.

The analysis was performed using **Tableau** to identify key drivers of low profit margins and to recommend **data-driven, actionable business decisions** for improving overall operating performance.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
Despite generating significant sales volume, the company experiences **low or negative profit margins in several states and product sub-categories**.

Stakeholders lack clarity on:
- Why certain states underperform in profitability
- Whether discounts are contributing to revenue growth or profit erosion
- Which product segments require immediate corrective action

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objectives of this analysis are to:
- Evaluate **profit margin performance** across states, categories, and segments
- Identify the **impact of discounting** on profitability
- Detect **loss-making products and regions**
- Provide **actionable recommendations** to improve median profit margins without significantly affecting sales volume

---

## 📈 Analysis Summary

### 🔑 Key KPIs
- **Total Sales:** $2.29M  
- **Total Profit:** $286K  
- **Total Quantity Sold:** 37,873 units  
- **Median Profit Margin:** ~27%

---

### 🔍 Key Insights

#### 1️⃣ Profit Margin Variation by Geography
- Several states consistently show **lower median profit margins**
- High-performing states maintain stable margins with **lower discount exposure**
- Low-performing states align strongly with **higher median discounts**

#### 2️⃣ Sub-Category Performance
- Sub-categories such as **Tables, Machines, and Bookcases** show:
  - High discount levels
  - Negative or near-zero profit margins
- Categories like **Office Supplies** maintain higher profitability despite moderate discounts

#### 3️⃣ Discount Patterns
- ~49% of products have a **median discount of 10%**
- ~33% of total sales originate from products with **10% median discount**
- Certain sub-categories receive **20–30% median discounts**, correlating with poor margins

#### 4️⃣ Segment-Level Behavior
- Consumer and Corporate segments show similar median discount levels
- Home Office segment applies lower discounts and maintains healthier margins

---

## 🚨 Problem Identified
The primary driver of low or negative profit margins in specific states is **excessive discounting applied to selected sub-categories**, rather than low demand or poor sales performance.

Key issues identified:
- Discounts are **not selectively optimized by region**
- High discounts are applied even to **low-margin products**
- Loss-making sub-categories continue to receive aggressive discounting

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Instead of a blanket discount reduction, a **targeted discount optimization strategy** is recommended:

- **Reduce median discounts by ~30–50%**  
  *only for identified loss-making sub-categories*
- Apply this reduction **specifically in low-performing states**
- Maintain current discount levels in **high-performing states** to avoid revenue risk

This selective approach aims to **improve median profit margin toward ~29%** while preserving sales stability.

---

## 📌 Additional Recommendations & Risks

### ✅ Recommendations
- Introduce **state-wise discount policies** instead of uniform pricing
- Cap maximum discounts for historically loss-making sub-categories
- Monitor **profit margin as a leading KPI**, not just sales volume
- Use pilot testing before rolling out discount changes nationwide

### ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Mitigation |
|----|----|
| Potential drop in sales volume | Pilot discount reduction in 2–3 states first |
| Customer price sensitivity | Maintain discounts on high-performing products |
| Over-correction | Track weekly margin & quantity changes post-adjustment |

## 📊 Tools & Techniques Used
- **Tableau** – Interactive dashboards & geospatial analysis
- **Calculated Fields** – Profit Margin, Median Discount
- **Visual Analytics** – Heatmaps, bar charts, maps
- **Business KPI Framework** – Margin-led decision making

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates that **profitability challenges are driven more by pricing and discount strategy than by demand**. By implementing **data-driven, selective discount optimization**, the company can significantly improve profit margins while maintaining revenue performance.
